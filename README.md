## SVM from Scratch

This repository offers a Python implementation of Support Vector Machines (SVM) from scratch using a quadratic solver like CXPY. It includes both soft margin and hard margin SVM algorithms.

### Overview

Explore Support Vector Machines (SVM) for classification tasks with this Jupyter Notebook. It covers various aspects of SVM and includes the following sections:

1. **Hard Margin SVM Implementation**: Implementing hard margin SVM algorithm from scratch.
2. **Exploring Problems with Hard Margin SVM**: Discussing limitations of hard margin SVM.
3. **Soft Margin SVM**: Introduction to soft margin SVM for more flexible decision boundaries.
4. **Handwritten Derivations for Soft Margin SVM**: Step-by-step derivations for better understanding.
5. **Experimentation and Analysis with Different Values of C**: Analyzing the impact of regularization parameter C.
6. **MNIST Dataset and SKLEARN Implementation**: Demonstrating SVM with MNIST dataset using scikit-learn.

### Key Concepts

- **Support Vector Machines (SVM)**: Supervised learning models for classification and regression tasks.
- **Hard Margin SVM**: Assumes linearly separable data without errors.
- **Soft Margin SVM**: Allows for misclassifications with a slack variable.
- **Hyperparameter C**: Controls trade-off between margin maximization and misclassification minimization.
- **SVM Kernels**: Linear, Polynomial, RBF, Sigmoid kernels for modeling complex decision boundaries.
- **Quadratic Solver used**: Utilizes CXPY to solve quadratic optimization problem in SVM training.
